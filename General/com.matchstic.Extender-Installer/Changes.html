            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Resolved issue where re-signs would continually re-occur until the 7-day window is passed.</p>
            <li>
              <p>Added automatic queuing of re-signs if the device is locked.</p>
            </li>

              <p>• +</p>
              <p>• &</p>
              <p>• @</p>
              <p>• -</p>
